# HatSpots MLP

This repository contains the Python code, examples, and model for the simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) called HatSpots, which predicts $\ln(Kd(nM))$ of a transcription factor E300 domain pairing. 


## About
This code supports the findings in the paper [(BLANK)]. NEED TO ADD DETAILS SIMILAR TO AN ABSTRACT

## HatSpot Workflow
We implemented [Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM2 650M)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade2574) embeddings as inputs to our HatSpot MLP rather than just inputting the TF or EP300 domain sequence.
